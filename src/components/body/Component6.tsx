      <h2>Interfaces in TypeScript</h2>
      <p>
        nterfaces in TypeScript are a powerful way to define and enforce the
        structure of objects and classes. They provide a way to describe the
        shape of an object, including the properties it should have and their
        types. Interfaces help in maintaining a clear contract for how different
        parts of a program should interact, ensuring consistency and reducing
        errors.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Features of Interfaces:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Defining Object Shapes:</span> nterfaces allow
          you to define the expected structure of an object. For instance:
          <Code
            code={`interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    greet(): void;
}`}
          />
          This <code>Person</code> interface specifies that any object adhering
          to this interface must have a <code>name</code> of type{" "}
          <code>string</code>, an <code>age</code> of type <code>number</code>,
          and a <code>greet</code> method that returns <code>void.</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Implementing Interfaces:</span> Classes can
          implement interfaces to ensure they conform to a specific structure.
          For example:
          <Code
            code={`class Employee implements Person {
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
    
    greet() {
        console.log(\`Hello, my name is \${this.name}.\`);
    }
}`}
          />
          The <code>Employee</code> class adheres to the <code>Person</code>{" "}
          interface, guaranteeing that it has the required properties and
          methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Extending Interfaces:</span> Interfaces can
          extend other interfaces, allowing you to build on existing structures:
          <Code
            code={`interface Address {
    street: string;
    city: string;
}

interface PersonWithAddress extends Person {
    address: Address;
}`}
          />
          Here, <code>PersonWithAddress</code> extends <code>Person</code> by
          adding an <code>address</code> property, combining the structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Optional Properties and Methods:</span> You can
          define optional properties and methods using a question mark (
          <code>?</code>):
          <Code
            code={`interface Car {
    brand: string;
    model: string;
    year?: number;  // Optional property
}`}
          />
          The <code>year</code> property is optional, meaning that objects of
          type <code>Car</code> may or may not include it
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Indexable Types:</span> Interfaces can describe
          objects that are indexable, such as arrays or dictionaries:
          <Code
            code={`interface StringArray {
    [index: number]: string;
}

let myArray: StringArray = ["Alice", "Bob"];`}
          />
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Benefits of Using Interfaces:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Type Safety:</span> Interfaces ensure that
          objects adhere to a defined structure, reducing the likelihood of
          errors and improving code reliability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Code Readability and Maintainability:</span>{" "}
          Clearly defined interfaces make it easier to understand the data
          structures in use and how they interact with different parts of the
          application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">Reusability:</span> Interfaces can be reused
          across multiple classes and functions, promoting consistent design
          patterns and reducing redundancy.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Interfaces in TypeScript are crucial for designing robust and scalable
        applications, as they enforce structure and consistency while providing
        flexibility for complex types.
